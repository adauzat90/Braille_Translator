Hi aunt Marj! 
I loved getting your letter, I am afraid I am very out of practice though. So I am going to try and write at least one letter a month (even when I am in Maine) or more until school starts up again. I am so so sorry to hear about Joan. How is everyone in chior doing? Is everyone else doing as well as can be expected? 
How is Leona? I sent her a text today but I want to write it down too.
There were a few things in your last letter which I couldn’t understand. I don’t know if I forgot the contractions or if some letters got left out, but I am going to rewrite the section on a card and send it to you separately because I want to know what I missed. The creased paper was the issue I thought it was going to be, but it wasn’t exactly ‘easy’ to read after I had folded and unfolded it a few times - oops! 

Finals are nearly over, I have three left, one on Monday and two on Friday. After that I am going to spend a few days with a freind and then a few days with aunt Betty and then a few days at home and then I am going to go see Bob. It’s going to be nice, seeing everyone, but a lot of driving. It reminds me of the road trip out to Bethel, I really enjoyed that. I am going to start online classes in June, I think I will be happy with that choice over all because it means I will be able to spend extra time with you and uncle Hugh as long as I remember to do my homework. This weekend I am going to the wedding of Mary Ellen’s oldest son. I am really looking forward to seeing the family and I am really happy for him.
I think you would like one of my new friends. He is an ex-Marine with a service dog in training, maybe I’ve mentioned him before. But his dog Vidar (said Viter, rhymes with ‘biter’) is such a sweet dog, a lot like Lowes when he was that little. He has a tongue that wants to lick EVERYTHING, and will lick you until you feel like you’ve had a shower! i know you would like this puppy. Oh! I still need to fix the name tag for Gail when I come up this summer, don’t let me forget! Such a wonderful dog deserves the right spelling on her likeness! 

I miss you and I can’t wait to see you! Love Paige
